' "" "" i will tell you the truth concerning that , o conan , "" said fionn . "" oisin , caoilte , mac lughaidh , diarmuid o'duibhne , and myself happened one day , above all other days , to be on the summit of cairn feargall . we were accompanied by our five hounds , namely , bran , sceoluing , sear dubh , luath luachar , and anuaill . we had not long been there when we perceived a rough , tall , huge giant approaching us . he carried an iron fork upon his back , and a grunting hog was placed between the prongs of the fork ; a young girl of mature age followed and forced the giant on his way before her . ' let someone go forward and accost those people , ' said i. diarmuid o'duibhne followed , but did not overtake them . the other three and i started up , and followed diarmuid and the giant . we overtook diarmuid , but did not come up with the giant or the girl ; for a dark , gloomy , druidical mist showered down between us and them , so that we could not discern what road they took . when the mist cleared away we looked around us , and discovered a light - roofed , comfortable - looking house at the edge of the ford near at hand . we proceeded to the house , before which spread a lawn upon which were two fountains . at the brink of one fountain lay a rude iron vessel , and a vessel of bronze at the brink of the other . those we met in the house were an aged , hoary - headed man standing by the door jamb to the right hand , and a beautiful maid sitting before him ; a rough , rude , huge giant before the fire busily cooking a hog ; and an old man at the other side of the fire , having an iron - grey head of hair and twelve eyes in his head , while the twelve sons ( germs ) of discord beamed in each eye . "" ' o fionn , ' asked the man of the door - post , ' do you feel surprised at the appearance and arrangements of this house ? ' i assured him that i never saw anything which surprised me more . ' well , then , i will explain the meaning of all these things to you , ' said the man . ' the giant carrying the grunting hog between the prongs of the iron fork , whom you first saw , is he who is yonder , and his name is sloth . she who is close to me is the young woman who had been forcing him along , that is energy ; and energy compels sloth forward with her ; for energy moves , in the twinkling of the eye , a greater distance than the foot can travel in a year . the old man of the bright eyes yonder signifies the world ; and he is more powerful than anyone , which has been proved by his rendering the ram powerless . that ram which you saw signifies the crimes of the man . that hag there beyond is withering old age , and her clothing has withered your four men . the two wells from which you drank the two draughts mean falsehood and truth ; for while telling a lie one finds it sweet , but it becomes bitter at the last . cuanna from innistuil is my own name . i do not reside here , but having conceived a wonderful love for you , o fionn , on account of your superiority in wisdom and general celebrity , i therefore put those things into the way before you in order that i might see you . and this story shall be called , to the end of the world , the hospitality of cuanna 's house to fionn . let you and your men come together , and do ye five sleep until morning . ' accordingly we did so , and when we awoke in the morning we found ourselves on the summit of cairn feargaill , with our hounds and arms by us . so there is the meaning of the byword , ' the hospitality of fionn in the house of cuanna , ' o conan , said fionn .

character,"he straightway ordered faithful to be brought before him , and threatened him with death if he did not at once hurry into the hill and bring back the wife of whom he had been robbed . if he were successful great honor should be his reward . in vain faithful denied what unfaithful had said of him , the king stuck to his demand , and the youth withdrew , convinced that he had not long to live . then he went to the stable to bid farewell to his beautiful horse , and stood beside him and wept . "" what grieves you so ? "" asked the horse . then the youth told him of all that had happened , and said that this was probably the last time he would be able to visit him . "" if it be no more than that , "" said the horse , "" there is a way to help you . up in the garret of the castle there is an old fiddle , take it with you and play it when you come to the place where the queen is kept . and fashion for yourself armor of steel wire , and set knives into it everywhere , and then , when you see the troll open his jaws , descend into his maw , and thus slay him . but you must have no fear , and must trust me to show you the way . "" these words filled the youth with fresh courage , he went to the king and received permission to leave , secretly fashioned his steel armor , took the old fiddle from the garret of the castle , led his dear horse out of the stable , and without delay set forth for the troll 's hill . inconsolable , he went to his beautiful horse , wept and wanted to say farewell to him forever . "" what troubles you ? "" asked the horse . and the youth replied : "" unfaithful has again been telling lies about me , and if i do not bring the troll 's golden hall to the queen , my life will be forfeited . "" "" is it nothing more serious than that ? "" said the horse . "" see that you obtain a great ship , take your fiddle with you and play the golden hall out of the hill , then hitch the troll 's horses before it , and you will be able to bring the glistening hall here without trouble . "" then faithful felt somewhat better , did as the horse had told him , and was successful in reaching the great hill . and as he stood there playing the fiddle , the golden hall heard him , and was drawn to the sounding music , and it moved slowly , slowly , until it stood outside the hill . it was built of virgin gold , like a house by itself , and under it were many wheels . then the youth took the troll 's horses , put them to the golden hall , and thus brought it aboard his ship . soon he had crossed the lake , and brought it along safely so that it reached the castle without damage , to the great joy of the queen . yet despite the fact , she was as weary of everything as she had been before , never spoke to her husband , the king , and no one ever saw her laugh . now faithful knew quite well that he could not hope to catch the troll 's wild colts , and he once more turned to the stable in order to bid farewell to the huldra 's gift . "" why do you weep over such a trifle ? "" said the horse . "" hurry to the wood , play your fiddle , and all will be well !
